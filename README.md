This is the implementation of the geolocation models described in the following two papers:

The models include text-based classification, network-based label propagation (regression)
and network-based label propagation (classification).

For the classification models, the real-valued coordinates of the training points are clustered using
k-d tree and each cluster (region) is assigned a label. This implementation expects the clusters to be
written into a text file each cluster a line.
For example:


    lat1,lon1	lat2,lon2
    lat3,lon3	lat4,lon4

This program expects three separate training, dev and test gzipped files in each, a user is represented as a line with the following
format:

    username	latitude	longitude	aggregated-tweets-of-user-including-mentions
