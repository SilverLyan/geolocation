##Models
The models include text-based classification, network-based label propagation (regression)
and network-based label propagation (classification).

##Data
###Clusters (regions) for classification models
For the classification models, the real-valued coordinates of the training points are clustered using
k-d tree and each cluster (region) is assigned a label. This implementation expects the clusters to be
written into a text file where training point members of each cluster are written in one line tab-separated.
For example int the following example we have 2 clusters (regions) each with two training points:


    lat1,lon1	lat2,lon2
    lat3,lon3	lat4,lon4

###Training, development and test input files
This program expects three separate training, dev and test gzipped files in each, a user is represented as a line with the following
format:

    username	latitude	longitude	aggregated-tweets-of-user-including-mentions

    
Note: The datasets used are different from those used in:
Wing, Benjamin, and Jason Baldridge. "Hierarchical Discriminative Classification for Text-Based Geolocation." EMNLP. 2014.
in that we have rebuilt the datasets to include mention information.

##Configuration
All the configuration parameters are in params.py which should be changed according to the environment.
